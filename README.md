# Life inside `await`

## Pill Category

Language (C#)

## Description

This is a tentative of reverse engineering the `async-await` mechanism.

Please, be aware that this Pill will not present the exact code that exists behind the `async-await`, but it will try, using a few examples, to explain what `async-await` does behind the scene.

### Question

- What is doing the `await` behind the scene? What is the level of magic needed to understand it?
